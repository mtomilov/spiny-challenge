Why mongo?
Great for prototyping, would go for redis for speed and for postgres for relational data.

Avenues for improvement:
- separate container for tasks
- celery or the like for complex task management
- consider using mongo time series
- consider storing documents by keyword
- refactor layout
- add development docker
